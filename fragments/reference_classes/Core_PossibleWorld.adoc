|DEF: A WholeLifeIndividual that is a complete spatio-temporal history of some possible world. The actual world is one of the possible worlds.

EXAMPLES: a description could contain two PossibleWorlds, the possible world where carA stopped at the pedestrian crossing and where carA did not stop. 

USAGE: Use this class to model modality (modal realism rather than modal logic), such as several possible planned futures or alternative pasts.
