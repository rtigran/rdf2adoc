|DEF: A State that consists of a distribution of matter and/or energy. A PhysicalObjectState is understood to have a bounded distribution, and so it can be identified as that parcel of matter and/or energy over time.  A PhysicalObjectState can be thought of as characterizing what does not change over time of a State.
