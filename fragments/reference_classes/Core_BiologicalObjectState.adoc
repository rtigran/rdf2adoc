|Comments
|DEF: A PhysicalObjectState that sustains itself and reproduces. A BiologicalObjectState may represent the whole life of the object or a temporal part of it.

EXAMPLES: a BiologicalObjectState that is not an OrdinaryBiologicalObjectState would be one that survives the replacement of all of its parts, so an example might be my dog (which might be a completely different dog over time).

USAGE: generally use OrdinaryBiologicalObjectState instead of this class
