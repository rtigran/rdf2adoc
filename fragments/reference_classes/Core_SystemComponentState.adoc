|DEF: A PhysicalObjectState that represents a component of a system. The state may represent the whole life of the component or a temporal part of it. The state can be completely replaced without losing its identity. A SystemComponentState can only exist when the System exists.  On the other hand, the OrdinaryPhysicalObject that is installed as the component may exist before or after the System.

EXAMPLES: vehicles and pedestrians are components of the traffic system (actually FunctionalSystemComponentStates - not WholeLifeIndividuals because the whole life of a vehicle or pedestrian would include temporal parts that are not components of the same traffic system)

USAGE: Use this class only for physical objects that are components of systems that do not have specific functions (are not FunctionalSystems)
