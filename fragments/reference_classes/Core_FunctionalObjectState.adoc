|DEF: An IntentionallyConstructedObjectState and PhysicalObjectState that has an intendedRole. A FunctionalObjectState may represent the whole life of the object or a temporal part of it.

EXAMPLES: a FunctionalObjectState that is not an OrdinaryFunctionalObjectState would be one that survives the replacement of all of its parts, so an example might be my car (which might be a completely different car over time).

USAGE: generally use OrdinaryFunctionalObjectState instead of this class
